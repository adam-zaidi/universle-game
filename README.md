# 🎓 Universle

**Universle** is a geography-style guessing game for universities — inspired by *Collegedle* and *Tradle*, but built around U.S. colleges and universities.  
Each day (or page reload, in dev mode), a random university is chosen. Your goal is to guess which one it is using location, distance, and hints.
